# SDG Assignment #24 : 07 - 01 - Reactified Octocats

Upgraded static HTML & CSS page with React Components

![React Octocats Demo](https://github.com/codyb23/SDG-GIFS/blob/master/PhotoGallery.gif)

### Requirements
- [x] If you have done the non-React version of octodex, use your existing HTML as the `render()` method of your `App` component. Otherwise, figure out the main components of the page and implement the `render()` method of `App`
- [x] Your CSS should be in `index.css` -- feel free to copy your previous project's css if you have done the non-React version of this assignment.
- [x] You should have at _least_ two components... (Hint, perhaps Header, and an Octocat)
- [x] Use props to try to reuse components (reuse the Octocat component)

### Above and Beyond
- [x] Place the definition of each Octocat in an `array` of objects and use `map` to generate the Octocat components
